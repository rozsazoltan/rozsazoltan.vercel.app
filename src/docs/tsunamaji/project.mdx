## Goals

Tsunamaji is a powerful extension of the Tailwind ecosystem, built to scale it in a structured way. Through a collection of plugins and utility packages, we deliver baseline-driven CSS properties straight into your project - so you can build with confidence, without worrying about browser compatibility surprises.

## Meaning of the Tsunamaji

The name Tsunamaji combines tsunami - representing a powerful, unstoppable wave - with magic, symbolizing creativity, surprise, and transformative impact. Together, the name conveys the idea of unleashing the full potential of Tailwind CSS in a structured and enchanting way. It's a wave of utility and innovation that developers can harness with confidence.
