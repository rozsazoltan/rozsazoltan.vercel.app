## Plugins: Tailwind CLI, PostCSS, Vite

Starting from v4, Tailwind CSS separated the CLI and PostCSS plugin parts from the main package. Since the CLI is no longer required in every case (thers's <Link href="#is-the-init-process-necessary">no need to run the `init` process</Link>), they also introduced a new Vite plugin.

</TipLearn>

## Where is the `tailwind.config.js`?

**It has been removed.** Instead, a new CSS-first configuration approach has been introduced, using several new Tailwind CSS-specific functions such as `@theme`, `@plugin`, `@utility`, `@variant`, `@custom-variant`, and many others.

Almost every setting that was previously available can now be implemented using the v4 CSS-first configuration. There are some exceptional cases, like `backgroundImage`, but I'll try to highlight a few of those later.

<CodeExampleStack>
```js
/* [!code filename:tailwind.config.js (not avaliable from v4)] */
// Legacy JavaScript-based configuration
/* [!code --:22] */
import typographyPlugin from '@tailwindcss/typography'

export default {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        avocado: {
          '100': oklch(0.99 0 0),
          '200': oklch(0.98 0.04 113.22),
          '300': oklch(0.94 0.11 115.03),
        },
        fontFamily: {
          'sans': ['Satoshi', 'sans-serif'],
        },
      },
    },
  },
  plugins: [
    typographyPlugin,
  ],
}
```
```css
/* [!code filename:main.css] */
/* New CSS-first configuration */
@import "tailwindcss";

/* [!code ++:2] */
@plugin "@tailwindcss/typography";

/* [!code ++:7] */
@theme {
  --color-avocado-100: oklch(0.99 0 0);
  --color-avocado-200: oklch(0.98 0.04 113.22);
  --color-avocado-300: oklch(0.94 0.11 115.03);
  --font-sans: ""Satoshi", "sans-serif";
}
```
</CodeExampleStack>

### Is the `init` process necessary?

**There's no longer any need to run the `npx tailwindcss init` command**, as its sole purpose was to create the `tailwind.config.js` file. So, if you do try to run it, you'll get an error saying the command is not found or not recognized.

### CSS-first configuration

Simply write your configuration in CSS files.

<TipStar>

</TipLearn>

### VSCode only throws warnings: Unknown directives

Up until v3, people often used PostCSS plugins to partially hide these types of warnings. However, starting with v4, a number of new Tailwind CSS-specific syntaxes have been introduced. That's why it's important to use the official Tailwind CSS VSCode extension:
* <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss" target="_blank">Official Tailwind CSS IntelliSense extension for VSCode</a>

If you've installed it, make sure to associate the `*.css` files with the Tailwind CSS syntax either in your current workspace (where you're working with Tailwind CSS) or in your global settings like this:

```json
/* [!code filename:settings.json] */
{
  "files.associations": {
    /* [!code highlight:2] */
    "*.css": "tailwindcss",
  },
}
```

## Automatic Source detection

### How do I declare my sources in the content property?

With the <Link href="#where-is-the-tailwindconfigjs">removal of `tailwind.config.js`</Link>, the question of where to list the paths in the `content` property in v4 is valid. The answer is: nowhere. By default, Tailwind CSS automatically discovers all your source files.

It ignores paths declared in `.gitignore` and the `node_modules` folder. Important: from v4 onward, it's recommended to develop every project within a git repository.

* <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/detecting-classes-in-source-files#which-files-are-scanned" target="_blank">Which files are scanned</a>
* <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/79694694/15167500" target="_blank">Is `git init` required when using the TailwindCSS v4?</a>

You can manually add extra external paths or disable internal paths afterwards.

```css
/* [!code filename:CSS] */
@import "tailwindcss";

/* [!code highlight:2] */
@source "../node_modules/@acmecorp/ui-lib";
```

### If you don't want automation

This is possible - the automation can be completely disabled when importing Tailwind CSS. In that case, you need to specify every path manually:

```css
/* [!code filename:CSS] */
/* [!code word:source(none)] */
@import "tailwindcss" source(none);

/* [!code highlight:2] */
@source "../html";
@source "../node_modules/@acmecorp/ui-lib";
```

Or you can declare a default base path, which can also be manually extended:

```css
/* [!code filename:CSS] */
/* [!code word:source("../html")] */
@import "tailwindcss" source("../html");

@source "../node_modules/@acmecorp/ui-lib";
```

## Safelist

### So, does that mean safelist can no longer be used?

Although there was no alternative available in v4.0, it was reintroduced starting from v4.1. By extending the previous `@source inline` directive, you can declare safelisted class names.

```css
/* [!code filename:CSS] */
@import "tailwindcss";

/* [!code highlight:2] */
@source inline("{hover:,focus:,}underline");
```

* <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/79406229/15167500" target="_blank">How is it possible to specify a safelist in TailwindCSS v4? Is it possible to list patterns and variants instead of full class names?</a>

<TipWarning>
  Class names placed in the safelist will always be included in the production build, regardless of whether they are used or not. Excessive use of the safelist results in a larger output file, which means bigger file sizes and more network traffic. Make sure to carefully consider which classes you add to the safelist. Whenever possible, it is recommended to look for other alternatives.
</TipWarning>

### Is it also possible to exclude class names in the same way?

Yes. The `@source not` directive can exclude not only paths but also `inline` class names.

```css
/* [!code filename:CSS] */
@import "tailwindcss";

/* [!code highlight:2] */
@source not inline("{hover:,focus:,}bg-red-{50,{100..900..100},950}");
```

## Utilities

### Functional utilities instead of statically

Static `padding`, `margin`, `height`, `width`, and other utilities have been removed. Instead, dynamically computed functional utilities have been introduced, allowing values to be used from 1 up to infinity.

```html
<!-- [!code filename:HTML] -->
<!-- [!code word:p-123] -->
<!-- [!code word:my-52] -->
<!-- [!code word:max-h-99] -->
<!-- [!code word:min-w-13] -->
<div class="p-123 my-52 max-h-99 min-w-13 ...">
  Hello Functional Utilities
</div>
```

### Dropping `@layer components` and `@layer utilities`

These were primarily used in v3 to declare special custom utilities. Starting from v4, a new @utility directive must be used for proper functionality.

```css
/* [!code filename:CSS] */
/* [!code --:6] */
@layer utilities {
  .tab-4 {
    tab-size: 4;
  }
}

/* [!code ++:4] */
@utility tab-4 {
  tab-size: 4;
}
```

There is also a custom syntax available for creating functional utilities:

```css
/* [!code filename:CSS] */
/* [!code --:9] */
@layer utilities {
  .tab-3 {
    tab-size: 3;
  }
  .tab-4 {
    tab-size: 4;
  }
}

/* [!code ++:4] */
@utility tab-* {
  tab-size: --value(integer);
}
```

## Functions

### Using the `theme()` function

Since v4 includes CSS variables for all of your theme values, we recommend using those variables instead of the `theme()` function whenever possible:

```css
/* [!code filename:CSS] */
.my-class {
  /* [!code --:2] */
  background-color: theme(colors.red.500);
  /* [!code ++:2] */
  background-color: var(--color-red-500);
}
```

For cases where you still need to use the `theme()` function (like in media queries where CSS variables aren't supported), you should use the CSS variable name instead of the old dot notation:

```css
/* [!code filename:CSS] */
/* [!code --:2] */
@media (width >= theme(screens.xl)) {
/* [!code ++:2] */
@media (width >= theme(--breakpoint-xl)) {
  /* ... */
}
```

### Using the `--spacing()` function

Use the --spacing() function to generate a spacing value based on your theme:

<CodeExampleStack>
```css
/* [!code filename:Input CSS] */
.my-element {
  /* [!code highlight:2] */
  margin: --spacing(4);
}
```
```css
/* [!code filename:Output CSS] */
.my-element {
  margin: calc(var(--spacing) * 4);
}
```
```html
<!-- [!code filename:The equivalent used in HTML] -->
<!-- [!code word:m-4] -->
<div class="m-4">...</div>
```
</CodeExampleStack>

This can also be useful in arbitrary values, especially in combination with `calc()`:

```html
<!-- [!code filename:HTML] -->
<!-- [!code word:py-[calc(--spacing(4)-1px)\]] -->
<div class="py-[calc(--spacing(4)-1px)]">...</div>
```

### Using the `--alpha()` function

Use the `--alpha()` function to adjust the opacity of a color:

<CodeExampleStack>
```css
/* [!code filename:Input CSS] */
.my-element {
  /* [!code highlight:2] */
  color: --alpha(var(--color-lime-300) / 50%);
}
```
```css
/* [!code filename:Output CSS] */
.my-element {
  color: color-mix(in oklab, var(--color-lime-300) 50%, transparent);
}
```
```html
<!-- [!code filename:The equivalent used in HTML] -->
<!-- [!code word:text-lime-300/50] -->
<div class="text-lime-300/50">...</div>
```
</CodeExampleStack>
