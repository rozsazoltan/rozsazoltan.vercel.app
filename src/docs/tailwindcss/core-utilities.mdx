  For example, <code>bg-red-500</code> sets the background color to a medium shade (500) from Tailwind's red scale ranging from 50 to 950.

You'll find a wide range of these utilities built into Tailwind by default - carefully crafted for nearly every CSS property. Later on, <Link href="/docs/tailwindcss/user-defined-utilities">you can extend or customize them</Link> as needed.
