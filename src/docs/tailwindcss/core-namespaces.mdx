<TipLearn>
  For example, <code>text-xl</code> corresponds to <code>2rem</code>. Tailwind provides a set of predefined namespaces you can easily use.
</TipLearn>

You'll find a wide range of these utilities built into Tailwind by default - carefully crafted for nearly every CSS property. Later on, <Link href="/docs/tailwindcss/user-defined-utilities">you can extend or customize them</Link> as needed.

Later, when creating <Link href="/docs/tailwindcss/user-defined-utilities">custom utilities</Link>, you can also reference also non-existent namespaces to <Link href="/docs/tailwindcss/user-defined-namespaces">define your own custom ones</Link>.

  Content creation is in progress. I'm writing it alone, unpaid, as a hobby. It may take me some time to complete everything.
