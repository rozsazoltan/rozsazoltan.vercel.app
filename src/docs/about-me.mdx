export const description = "I am Zoltán Rózsa, originally from Hungary. Thanks to the internet, I'm now from everywhere. We can connect anywhere - so since then, I've made sure to be everywhere. I work as a software developer.";

<TipLearn>
  Yes: in Hungary, the family name comes first, so it's written as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_names">Rózsa Zoltán</a>. That's where my "brand" name <Link href="/">rozsazoltan</Link> comes from. I see my family name as part of my identity - it translates to <a href="https://translate.google.com/?sl=hu&tl=en&text=R%C3%B3zsa&op=translate">Rose</a> in English, but I prefer the Hungarian pronunciation, so I usually don't translate or refer to myself using the English version.

## Early Beginnings

I first encountered the world of software development back in **2008**. My father, a developer skilled in **Pascal** and **Delphi**, made an effort to introduce me to programming. At the time, I found it overwhelmingly difficult - something I now realize was mostly due to **language barriers**. I'm Hungarian, and while Hungarian is a beautiful language, **English fluency** is essential for staying current and accessing quality information in the IT field.

### Discovering Web Development  
Driven by my own interest, I began learning **PHP**. I was drawn to **web development** because I could instantly publish my projects online - unlike C, Java, or Delphi applications, which, while shareable, weren't runnable by default. The idea of **distributing my work without requiring installation** was a game-changer.

### Expanding Skills  
My interest in PHP naturally led me to **JavaScript**. As a **solo developer**, I found it important to understand both the **backend** and **frontend**. Along the way, I also learned:
* **SQL** and database design principles
* **Backend–frontend communication** via APIs
* **HTTP headers** and **security protocols**
* **Server control panels** and **DNS configuration**
* and much more...

I absorbed knowledge step by step, exploring and mastering various **frameworks**. Today, I can quickly adapt to new systems - one day writing **Vue**, the next **React**, and then working in **Laravel**.

### To grow, to improve, and never stop evolving

Using my **JavaScript skills**, I've really enjoyed building both **desktop** and **mobile applications** too – initially with **Electron** and **Capacitor**, and more recently with **Tauri**.

I've also developed **browser extensions** and **VSCode plugins**, all thanks to my JavaScript background. Honestly, I just **love working with JavaScript** in almost every context. 

That said, when it comes to **backend development**, I'm firmly rooted in **PHP**. I connect my backend services to any frontend application **seamlessly through APIs**.

**Writing tests** is something I also enjoy. I used to work with **PHPUnit** and **Jest**, but these days I prefer **PestPHP** and **Vitest**.

I have a soft spot for writing **refactoring scripts** as well. Currently, I use **RectorPHP** and **ESLint** for that purpose.

### Summary

I develop websites, desktop and mobile applications, browser extensions, and other PHP and JavaScript software. I can configure appropriate APIs for these projects and am experienced with various SQL database engines. By writing tests and performing refactoring, I strive to keep my projects clean and maintainable. Through clear documentation, others can easily join the development process or use the Composer and NPM packages I create.

## Continuous Learning and Sharing  
I constantly develop my skills by following online content and creators. I noticed that information sticks better if I share it with juniors and other developers. That's why, for several years now, I've been helping others - mainly on **Stack Overflow**, but also on **GitHub** repositories and various **Discord** servers. I believe sharing knowledge benefits both myself and the community.

### Vision  
This motivation led me to run my own website. Since **revenue is not the goal**, I host a free site on **Vercel**, built with **Next.js** and styled with **Tailwind CSS**. The code is published on GitHub for **educational purposes**, not for distribution.

I want to share my experiences with the world. Although many have written similar things, one more or less explanation can't hurt. Writing down my thoughts helps me reflect and engage with feedback - both positive encouragement and constructive criticism have always motivated me and helped me grow.

## Collaboration & Opportunities

If you would like to collaborate with me, please get in touch. I am open to job offers and project invitations.

<TipHighlight>
  Although I strive to teach for free, I still need to generate some income, so content creation is secondary - a kind of hobby - for me.

## Off the Keyboard

I've been playing chess since I was a child and participated in many competitions. One of my favorite openings is the Danish Gambit. I enjoy playing in Sicilian and King's Indian Defense systems.

<TipLearn>
  As a software developer, I love open source projects. For online chess, I chose [Lichess](https://github.com/lichess-org).
</TipLearn>

I'm generally an aggressive player, starting strong and then aiming for quick victories through surprising moves and big sacrifices. I think my work approach is similar: I prefer to invest more effort upfront in my code to make it quickly functional, so I can continue developing it into something profitable.

<TipHighlight>
  I believe chess and software development share a lot of logical similarities.
</TipHighlight>

After finishing high school, my strong passion for playing became more of a side hobby, and I started focusing more on fulfilling my potential in software development.

Besides that, I love cycling - anywhere, anytime, and with anyone. Lately, I've realized I really enjoy cooking, especially disc cooking or cooking outdoors in a cauldron. You haven't truly tasted authentic Hungarian food until you've tried a spicy and flavorful beef stew.
