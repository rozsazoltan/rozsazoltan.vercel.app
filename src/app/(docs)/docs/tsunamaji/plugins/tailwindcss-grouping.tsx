For example, instead of writing `lg:p-12 lg:bg-emerald-300 lg:text-emerald-500 lg:dark:bg-emerald-800 lg:dark:text-emerald-500`, it enforces the following: `lg:(p-12,bg-emerald-300,text-emerald-500,dark:(bg-emerald-800,text-emerald-500))`. In general, this would result in larger generated CSS, but with our plugin, it does not.",
