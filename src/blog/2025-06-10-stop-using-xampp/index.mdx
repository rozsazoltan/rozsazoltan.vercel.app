## Why you should stop using XAMPP for PHP development

If you're still using XAMPP for local PHP development, it's time to reconsider. While XAMPP may seem like a convenient all-in-one solution - especially for beginners - it quickly becomes limiting and inefficient as your needs grow.

<TipBad>
  Difficult to manage multiple PHP bersions
</TipBad>
XAMPP doesn't make it easy to switch between PHP versions. If you're working on projects that require different versions (which is very common), managing them in XAMPP becomes messy and time-consuming.

<TipBad>
  Updating PHP means reinstalling everything
</TipBad>
Want to upgrade your PHP version? With XAMPP, that usually means reinstalling the entire stack - including Apache, MySQL, and PHP - then migrating your database and configurations manually. It's a fragile and error-prone process.

<TipBad>
  Comes loaded with unnecessary extras
</TipBad>
XAMPP ships with a lot of components you probably don't need - especially when you're just starting out. These extras can clutter your setup, cause conflicts, and slow down your machine.

<TipBad>
  Misleading & bad habits
</TipBad>
In many cases, it points beginner developers in the wrong direction - encouraging them to do everything inside the `htdocs` folder. This is a bad habit. Even from the very beginning, it's better to host each project in its own dedicated environment or directory, tailored specifically to that project.

## Okay, but what should I use instead - and why?

There are several alternatives available. Personally, I prefer using CLI tools that focus solely on PHP or the database engine. These tools allow me to install and configure both global and local PHP versions with ease. I can even run multiple PHP versions simultaneously.

There are also GUI-based solutions that offer similar functionality - such as support for multiple PHP versions and the flexibility to store your projects anywhere on your system.

<TipHighlight>
  This article assumes that the reader is familiar with basic package managers and knows which one is required - or preferred - for their operating system.

### 1. jdx.mise - Open Source, Free

* [GitHub: `jdx/mise`](https://github.com/jdx/mise)
* [Website: `mise.jdx.dev`](https://mise.jdx.dev)

<TipWarning>
  It's my personal favorite, but the currently available plugin for PHP is unstable - especially on Windows. For a more stable solution, keep reading.
</TipWarning>

<TipGood>
  Not just for PHP - a powerful CLI tool for developers
</TipGood>
Mise is a versatile CLI tool designed not just for managing PHP versions. With mise, you can also manage Node.js, npm, pnpm, Composer, Go, Python, Java, and many other development tools and runtimes - all from a single interface.

* [Core tools](https://mise.jdx.dev/core-tools.html)
* [Backends](https://mise.jdx.dev/dev-tools/backends)

<TipGood>
  Node.js compatibility included
</TipGood>
Most PHP developers eventually need Node.js as well - especially when working with front-end tooling. It's common to require different Node.js versions for different projects. Mise handles this seamlessly, giving you version control for both PHP and Node.js in one place.

<TipGood>
  One place for all development-tools
</TipGood>
While Composer (PHP's package manager) includes a built-in self-update mechanism, I love that mise keeps everything centralized. Instead of installing tools all over the operating system, mise allows you to manage all your essential development tools in a clean, version-controlled structure.

<TipGood>
  Easy to migrateacross machines
</TipGood>
Once you're familiar with the necessary CLI commands, it's incredibly easy to replicate your setup on a new machine. You can quickly install all previously used versions on a fresh OS without starting from scratch.

<TipGood>
  Cross-platform support
</TipGood>
Mise is fully cross-platform - available for Windows, Linux, and macOS - making it a great choice regardless of your development environment.

<TipBad>
  Command-line focused
</TipBad>
Lacks the GUI interface found in some competing tools.

#### Manage PHP

Install vfox backend plugin for PHP.
```sh
mise use -g vfox:version-fox/vfox-php
```

<TipCompat>
  The `vfox-php-plugin` relies on the official PHP websites. However, PHP distributes its Windows and Linux-compatible releases on separate pages - and even handles the latest versions on a different one. As a result, the plugin may not always work as intended.

  To solve this, I'm collecting all PHP installer versions in my own GitHub repository and pulling the appropriate one during installation through a custom plugin. I'll be updating the plugin usage soon to rely on my own version.

  * [`jdx/mise` #4566 - Installing PHP on Windows](https://github.com/jdx/mise/discussions/4566)
  * [`verzly/php` - PHP releases](https://github.com/verzly/php/releases)
  * [`verzly/mise-php` - New PHP-plugin for Mise](https://github.com/verzly/mise-php) (Coming Soon)
</TipCompat>

Install PHP 8 globally.
```sh
# [!code highlight:2]
mise use --global php@8 # install php 8 and set it as the global default

mise exec -- php my-script.php # run my-script.php with php 8
mise exex -- php artisan serve # run artisan from laravel project with php 8
```

* [mise `exec` adn `run`](https://mise.jdx.dev/getting-started.html#mise-exec-run)

#### Environment variables

While using `mise x|exec` is useful, for interactive shells, you might prefer to activate mise to automatically load the mise context (tools and environment variables) in your shell session. Another option is to use shims.

`mise activate` method updates your environment variable and PATH every time your prompt is run to ensure you use the correct versions.

<TipLearn>
  Environment variables are system-specific values that are accessible across the entire system. One common environment variable is `PATH`, which contains a list of directory paths. These directories are where the system looks for executable files, allowing you to run programs without typing their full path.

  For example, if you place mysoftware.exe at `C:\software\bin\mysoftware.exe`, you can run it from the command line like this: `C:\software\bin\mysoftware.exe` However, just typing `mysoftware` won't work - unless the system knows where to find it.

  To make the `mysoftware` command available globally (without specifying the full path), you need to add `C:\software\bin` to your system's `PATH` environment variable.
</TipLearn>

The `mise activate` command provides a quick solution for this. It automatically sets up the correct environment so that tools installed through mise - such as `php`, `nod`e, and others - are available globally from the command line, without needing to type the full path. This makes your development workflow much smoother and more efficient.

You only need to set it up the first time you run it - after that, the settings remain in your `PATH`.
```sh
mise activate
```

Now, instead of using `mise exec`, you can access `php` directly.
```sh
# [!code --:2]
mise exec -- php my-script.php # run my-script.php with php 8
# [!code ++:2]
php my-script.php

# [!code --:2]
mise exex -- php artisan serve # run artisan from laravel project with php 8
# [!code ++:2]
php artisan serve
```


### 2. asdf-vm - Open Source, Free

* [GitHub: `asdf-vm/asdf`](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf)
* [Website: `asdf-vm.com`](https://asdf-vm.com)

I won't go into as much detail as I did with `jdx.mise` - the two are very similar. In fact, `asdf-vm` was the inspiration behind the creation of `jdx.mise`. Understandably, `asdf-vm` has a few shortcomings or frustrations that make it less appealing - at least for me.

<TipBad>
  Command-line focused
</TipBad>
Lacks the GUI interface found in some competing tools.

It was recently rewritten in Go, and that's when I decided to switch to `jdx.mise`.

* [Getting started with `asdf-vm`](https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html)

Once installed, you can set up PHP like this:

```sh
asdf plugin-add php # install php plugin
```

```sh
asdf install php 8 # install php 8
asdf global php 8 # set php 8 as the global default
```

### 5. Laravel Herd - Freemium (Avaliable Pro License)

* [Website: `herd.laravel.com`](https://herd.laravel.com)

Laravel Herd is the latest local development environment released by Beyond Code, in collaboration with the Laravel team. It positions itself as a "one-click PHP development environment" - and honestly, I think that claim holds true.

I installed it directly from the official Laravel Herd website, and without any extra configuration, I was able to run all my existing Laravel (and Jigsaw) apps. I simply added the root paths of my projects to Herd's path configuration, and it automatically created local testing URLs for each of them. It really is that simple.

<TipGood>
  Instant setup
</TipGood>
Get up and running with your Laravel or PHP projects in seconds, no extra config required.

<TipGood>
  Automatic local routing
</TipGood>
Herd generates local domains for each project, so you can access them like `https://my-app.test`.

<TipGood>
  Multiple PHP versions supported
</TipGood>
You can run different apps on different PHP versions side-by-side.

<TipGood>
  Quick version switching

## Summary

While I believe a software developer shouldn't struggle with CLI tools, if you're really looking for a CLI-free solution, you might find what you need with the free <Link href="#5-laravel-herd-freemium-avaliable-pro-license">Laravel Herd</Link> (you can pay for extra features if you want, but they're not essential). 

For a CLI tool, <Link href="#3-pvm-open-source-free">PVM</Link> is an extremely simple solution - it's great if you're just starting out in this area. Otherwise, I'd definitely recommend <Link href="#1-jdxmise-open-source-free">jdx.mise</Link>.

<TipLearn>
  For Windows users, it's worth considering setting up a WSL 2 Linux environment and doing your PHP development within that instead.
